make mod compatible with Long War 2
	if LW2 loads later than this mod, then it erases all previous weapontemplates and adds its own
	LW2 provides hooks to re-add templates after LW2 initialized
	see LW2_Tuple
	
find out how the crash occured before with GameStates
	could not seem to reproduce
	

find out if its better to add Takedown to EVERY weapon with StandardShot and variants
	(see evac-all where it adds it to every char with the evac ability)



test notes:
-----
	TakedownShotCommonProperties
		remove return value
		use 'out' parameter?
-----
	fix TakedownShot
		eg. ability impairing conditions (stun, etc.) should disable it
-----
	pistol takedown doesn't work
-----
	TakedownShot doesn't work against props(exploding barrels, etc.)
		MarkedVictim could not be acquired
-----
	MarkForTakedown is available during viper bind
	probably TakedownShot too
-----
	seems the MarkEffect is still on the unit after a MarkShot
		may just be, that active effects check the triggered Takedown shots too
	see if it works with LW2 Command ability
		mark a unit
		trigger a takedown
		give an action point to the marker
		trigger another takedown

		shouldn't work (no more TakedownActionPoints reserved)
-----
	add concealment condition to abilities
-----
	check if suppression prevents marking
-----
	check if unreal allows assignment operators in if conditions
		and remove yoda codes if not!
-----
	multiple soldiers (B,C) have active marks
	soldier A does a step-out shot and kills enemy
	B,C would shoot, but won't (target is dead)
	a smaller lag spike happens
	A doesn't step back into cover
	game continues
	--
	may need a custom visualization function to solve this
-----
	show ToHit percentage during aiming
		has to rewrite deadeye aim so it will bring back the fail-on-miss bug
-----
	find special icons
-----
	find all TODO notes
-----
