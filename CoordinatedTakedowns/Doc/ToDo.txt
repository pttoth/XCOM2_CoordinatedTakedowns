make mod compatible with Long War 2
	if LW2 loads later than this mod, then it erases all previous weapontemplates and adds its own
	LW2 provides hooks to re-add templates after LW2 initialized
	see LW2_Tuple
	
find out how the crash occured before with GameStates
	could not seem to reproduce
	

find out if its better to add Takedown to EVERY weapon with StandardShot and variants
	(see evac-all where it adds it to every char with the evac ability)



test notes:
	currently doesn't add Takedown abilities to templates across all difficulties
		only Commander difficulty is available
-----
	multiple soldiers (B,C) have active marks
	soldier A does a step-out shot and kills enemy
	B,C would shoot, but won't (target is dead)
	a smaller lag spike happens
	A doesn't step back into cover
	game continues
	--
	may need a custom visualization function to solve this
-----
	soldier doesn't always end turn after marking
		need further investigation
		---
		first mark works
		second only end turn after third try
		third mark ends turn after second try
		--
		case:	different targets or the same ?
		--
		marks that don't end turn seem not to trigger after an offensive action

-----
	MarkForTakedown is available during viper bind
-----
	filter TakedownTriggerCheck errors more accurately
		they trigger for everything (eg. movement)
-----
	seems the MarkEffect is still on the unit after a MarkShot

-----		
	where's the crash ??????
		was it solved in the past ??
