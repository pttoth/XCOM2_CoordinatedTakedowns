primary:
	find a way to ensure that you add the abilities to modded weapons that are loaded AFTER this mod
	improve visualization so that the takedown shots happen simultaneously
		see chain lightning mod for example

	see if it works with 'TacticalSuppressors'


planned:
	see that all Long War 2 weapons which should have the ability, do have it

	don't allow Mark ability to be the last action of the squad
		think the cases through, but it might be a nice user experience improvement
	OR
		turn end should trigger remaining Takedown shots
			this seems like a really good choice
	seems the MarkEffect is still on the unit after a TakedownShot (before turn-end auto removes it. does it?)
		may just be, that active effects check the triggered Takedown shots too
		see if it works with LW2 Command ability
			mark a unit
			trigger a takedown
			give an action point to the marker (2nd case: mark another target)
			trigger another takedown
			shouldn't work (no more TakedownActionPoints reserved)
				2nd case may work, where the marker shoots again at the first marked unit instead
	see if it supports SnapShot
	find out how you can print messages to the in-game log, where abilities write
		you can use it to send notifications that the mod is outdated,
		if a patch would mess up players' ongoing campaigns
		this should only be possible when loading right into tactical saves with new version, but who knows...
	remove the mod class override (find an alternative means to work)
		where does it fail actually?
	find out if its better to add Takedown to EVERY weapon with StandardShot and variants
		see evac-all where it adds it to every char with the evac ability
		also determining squadsight availibility would be more consistent
			with the weapons' standard shots squadsight availability
	can make it work with AoE targeting launchers too
		not sure: various grenade types may spam UI
		do a normal grenade aim targeting
			save the target location somewhere
			if you can feed the saved location to the Takedown grenade shot ability,
				the rest should be straightforward
		psi abilities too (it may spam the ability UI however)
	find ModPreview picture
	find special icons
	solve all TODO notes

beautyfix:
	use ActionsPoints instead of ReserveActionPoints if you can
	move included headers from "Classes" 1 level up in the directoy hierarchy
	Concealment condition check improvements
		X2Condition_RequireConcealed class seems a little hacky	(not sure if works all the time)
		see X2Condition_Stealth for means of implementing solution

fixed but not tested:


test plans:
	mark an enemy
	trigger a scamper with a non agressive action
	try to trigger a takedown
		does it trigger a takedown? (i think it will)
		do normal shooting conditions matter?
		own, or enemy concealment matters?
	expected correct behavior:
		no takedown should take place after concealment is broken
		scamper should also trigger a takedown without agressive actions too
			basically should work exactly as an overwatch just with specific targets
-----
	check aim percentages
		enemy is in cover while patrolling
		triggering shot has full aim
		squad reveal
		markers take their TakedownShots
			do these shots have valid (cover-free) aim values?
-----
	check if suppression prevents marking
		shouldn't be possible with concealment
		except maybe:
			under suppression
			enter concealment
			try mark
-----
	Codex clone duplicates mark effect?
-----
	check how it works during mind control (is this even possible in a normal game?)
	---
		mark enemy
		mind control it
		trigger takedown
	---
		mind control an enemy
		add concealment to them (lol)
		mark an enemy with mind controlled unit
		lose control
		trigger takedown
	---
		mark
		let enemy mind control it (on your turn???)
		trigger takedown
-----
	multiple soldiers (B,C) have active marks
	soldier A does a step-out shot and kills enemy
	B,C would shoot, but won't (target is dead)
	a smaller lag spike happens
	A doesn't step back into cover
	game continues
	--
	may need a custom visualization function to solve this
