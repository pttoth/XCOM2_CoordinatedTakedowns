primary:
	TakedownShot doesn't work against props(exploding barrels, etc.)
		MarkedVictim could not be acquired
	pistol Mark has squadsight range
		shot too? (update: it doesn't, AA_NotInRange)
		normal mark too?

	remove the mod class override (find an alternative means to work)
		where does it fail actually?
	
	make mod compatible with Long War 2
		if LW2 loads later than this mod, then it erases all previous weapontemplates and adds its own
		LW2 provides hooks to re-add templates after LW2 initialized
		see LW2_Tuple
	add LW2 weapons to the mod!
	
planned:
	show ToHit percentage during aiming
		has to rewrite deadeye aim so it will bring back the fail-on-miss bug
	seems the MarkEffect is still on the unit after a TakedownShot (before turn-end auto removes it. does it?)
		may just be, that active effects check the triggered Takedown shots too
		see if it works with LW2 Command ability
			mark a unit
			trigger a takedown
			give an action point to the marker
			trigger another takedown

			shouldn't work (no more TakedownActionPoints reserved)
	find out if its better to add Takedown to EVERY weapon with StandardShot and variants
		see evac-all where it adds it to every char with the evac ability
	find special icons
	solve all TODO notes
beautyfix:
	use ActionsPoints instead of ReserveActionPoints if you can
	move included headers from "Classes" 1 level up in the directoy hierarchy


fixed but not tested:


test plans:
-----
	check aim percentages
		enemy is in cover while patrolling
		triggering shot has full aim
		squad reveal
		markers take their TakedownShots
			do these shots have valid (cover-free) aim values?
-----
	check if suppression prevents marking
		shouldn't be possible with concealment
		except maybe:
			under suppression
			enter concealment
			try mark
-----
	check how it works during mind control (is this even possible in a normal game?)
	---
		mark enemy
		mind control it
		trigger takedown
	---
		mind control an enemy
		add concealment to them (lol)
		mark an enemy with mind controlled unit
		lose control
		trigger takedown
	---
		mark
		let enemy mind control it (on your turn???)
		trigger takedown
-----
	multiple soldiers (B,C) have active marks
	soldier A does a step-out shot and kills enemy
	B,C would shoot, but won't (target is dead)
	a smaller lag spike happens
	A doesn't step back into cover
	game continues
	--
	may need a custom visualization function to solve this
